Steps to Compile and Run the app 

1) Install Flutter: Before you can compile and run a Flutter app, you will need to have the Flutter SDK
installed on your computer. You can download the Flutter SDK from the official Flutter website. i.e
https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
2) Install dependencies: Once you have installed the Flutter SDK, you will need to install the necessary 
dependencies. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal: flutter doctor. 
This will check your system for any missing dependencies and guide you through the installation process.
3) Set up an editor: You can use flutter recommended Editors i.e either Android 
Studio or Visual Studio Code. You will need to install the Flutter and Dart plugins for your chosen editor.
4) Import the flutter project by extracting the project files.
5) Run the app: To run the app, connect an Android or iOS device to your computer and run the following 
6) command in your terminal: flutter run. This will compile and run the app on your connected device.

Alternatively, you can also run the app on an emulator or simulator by using the following command: flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id> 
(replace <emulator_id> with the ID of the emulator you want to use) followed by flutter run. 
This will launch the specified emulator and run the app on it.
